# car

This repository contains all the software of the remote controlled car.

The software components are the followings:
* chassis: implementing the engine and body controllers within the car
* chassis_test: sw which tests all chassis functions (by simulating the interaction with a remote controller)
* gateway: communication gateway between the car chassis and the remote controller

Note that libraries are compiled separately in another project.
